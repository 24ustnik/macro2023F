# Purpose
This is a Flask web app that five peers and I made for the final challenge in the Software Development Macro in Fall of 2023. The goal was to create a web app that streamlines the crediting process and enables improvements for students, credit readers, parents, and administrators.

# Structure
Reader, student, admin, default, and home folder for routes. Reader, student, and admin service files. Static folder as well.

# Contribution

* Gabe built the application structure and wired up some pages.
* Niko wired up the pages, created the Grafana, and did some database design.
* Jonathan wrote a script that created test data.
